## VZ-Scripts

A series of scripts to automate many (sometimes annoying) OpenVz Tasks. Also my early attempts at learning Python

tun.py - Automate the enabling of tun/tapp using either ctid or ip. Can also send in multiple or combinations of the two and it will enable for all given

ppp.py - Automate the enabling of ppp using either ctid or ip. Can also send in multiple or combinations of the two and it will enable for all given

vz.py - Not run directly. Helper class and functions for all other scripts

ContainerNotFound.py - Custom Exception for when a container does not exist on the system
